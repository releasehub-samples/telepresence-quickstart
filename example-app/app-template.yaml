# This is an example Application Template with a frontend you can deploy to test with Telepresence.
# You'll want to copy-paste the uncommented sections into a new Application or merge into an existing
# App template created for test purposes. If you need a project to jumpstart your app, you can fork
# one of the demo apps at https://github.com/awesome-release
# #

# The commented lines below will be auto-generated for you when you first create your app template, 
# and will be unique to your account, app, git repo, and DNS settings. You should not include these 
# commented lines when copying/merging this file into your own template,they're only shown for reference:
